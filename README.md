RASVAMT
=======

RASVAMT stands for Radio Astronomy Survey Visualisation and Monitoring Tool. This is a project set-out to implement a tool specialised to support the planning and monitoring of the execution and reduction of large-scale, or all-sky surveys for Radio Astronomy. The idea is to implement this along the same ideas as the SVMT plugin for Stellarium, but very much aligned to the needs of Radio Astronomy. 
Primarily the project has been created as an educational software development project for computer science students, but the intention is to arrive at a fully working product by following an agile development model. This will be supported by using an agile development tool set as well as direct feedback from customers (scientists). The tool will be based on the Aladin-lite HTML5 widgets on the client side and probably a Python based server-side implementation. For more information please see the readme.txt inside the doc folder
