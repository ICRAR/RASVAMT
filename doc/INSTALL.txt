Installation Instructions

There are two type of installations feasible, the simplest is a local installation.
The requirements for such are a installation of python2.7 and the python package flask.
Some additional packages make life much easier pip ( python package management ) and virtualenv ( keeps env the same for build/ not necessary ).
NOTE: Most of the build was created using mac and linux.
	- Python and it's packages struggle with windows but maybe try using cygwin


[LOCAL INSTALLATION]
1. Check you have python version 2.7 ( attempt to run python2.7 /bin/python2.7 )
2. Get the Flask package. 
	- Either use *<sudo> pip install Flask *You may have to use sudo
	- Or visit http://flask.pocoo.org/ or clone from it's github
3. Run RASVAMA.sh -l
4. Visit localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000

[Full deploy using AWS]
A full deployment uses amazon web services (AWS) to create a cloud deployment.
It relies on a few extra packages to do this.
1. Get the python package fabric ( pip install fabric )
	- or visit http://www.fabfile.org/
	- Fabric is a ssh command line utility and allows us to easily set up our deployment
2. Get the python package boto:
	- Boto essentially allows you to connect and run stuff with AWS
3. Set up AWS essentials:
	- Need a key
	- Need IAM
4. Run RASVAMA.sh deploy
