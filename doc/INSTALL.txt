Installation Instructions
========================

There are two type of installations feasible, the simplest is a local installation.
The local installation is for those investigating the functionality of RASVAMA.
The second type creates a cloud instance using Amazon Web Services, this is used by ICRAR to host other software.

The requirements for a local installation are python2.7 and the python package flask.
Some additional packages make life much easier pip ( python package management ) and virtualenv ( keeps env the same for build/ not necessary ).
NOTE: Most of the build was created using mac and linux.
	- Python and it's packages struggle with windows but maybe try using cygwin


[LOCAL INSTALLATION]
1. Check you have python version 2.7 ( attempt to run python2.7 /bin/python2.7 )
2. Get the Flask package. 
	- Either use *<sudo> pip install Flask *You may have to use sudo
	- Or visit http://flask.pocoo.org/ or clone from it's github
3. Run RASVAMA.sh -l or in src dir run python main.py 
4. Visit localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000

[Full deploy using AWS]
A full deployment uses amazon web services (AWS) to create a cloud deployment.
It relies on a few extra packages to do this.
1. Get the python package fabric ( pip install fabric )
	- or visit http://www.fabfile.org/
	- Fabric is a ssh command line utility and allows us to easily set up our deployment
2. Get the python package boto:
	- Boto essentially allows you to connect and run stuff with AWS
3. Set up AWS essentials:
	- First youâ€™ll need an AWS account( https://aws.amazon.com/ )
	- Need a secret/key pair called RASVAMT.pem (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html ) 
	- Need secrurity group RASVAMT (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)
	- Need IAM ( your AWS access key and AWS secret key and this to home directory in file called .boto)
	- See AWS Installation for more advice
4. Run RASVAMA.sh
	or 
	fab test_deploy in src directory 

ii. 

Testing
=======
Tests for flask and  database are run automatically during deploy, but can test if server is deployed with `python liveserver_flask.py`.
Automated frontend tests can also be run using the selenium script (automated_frontend.py) in the testing directory, however this does require the selenium python package

iii.	Login name and passwords

aws_access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOURSECRETKEY


iv.	Other essential requirements

1. python 2.7			(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. Mac or Linux 		(Does not work on windows OS)
3. pip (optional) 		(https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
4. virtualenv (optional) 	(http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html#installation)
5. python package flask 	(http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/)



AWS installation
================
If logged in go to aws https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#users 
Create new key and download credentials
Create group adminsitrator
Add user to group
Configuring Boto Credentials
http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
Create instance
download security key
make sure add http to security rules
Next you will need a security key-pair which matches the US region east and a security group
called RASVAMT.pem maybe you might get that off him
cp this key into ~/.ssh/

You may also need github ssh keys 
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys



	- Need a secret/key pair called RASVAMT.pem
	- Need secrurity group RASVAMT
