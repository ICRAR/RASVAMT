AWS Installation Instructions
=============================

The local installation (install.txt) is for those investigating the functionality of RASVAMA.
This AWS installation creates a cloud instance using Amazon Web Services, this is used by ICRAR to host other software.

i.	Essential requirements
==============================

1. python 2.7			(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. Mac or Linux 		(Does not work on windows OS)
3. pip (optional) 		(https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
4. virtualenv (optional) 	(http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html#installation)
5. python package flask 	(http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/)


[Full deploy using AWS]
A full deployment uses amazon web services (AWS) to create a cloud deployment.
It relies on a few extra packages to do this.
1. Get the python package fabric ( pip install fabric )
	- or visit http://www.fabfile.org/
	- Fabric is a ssh command line utility and allows us to easily set up our deployment
2. Get the python package boto:
	- Boto essentially allows you to connect and run stuff with AWS
3. Set up AWS essentials:
	- First youâ€™ll need an AWS account( https://aws.amazon.com/ )
	- Need a secret/key pair called RASVAMT.pem (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html ) 
	- Need secrurity group RASVAMT (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)
	- Need IAM ( your AWS access key and AWS secret key and this to home directory in file called .boto)
	- See AWS Installation for more advice
4. Run RASVAMA.sh
	or 
	fab test_deploy in src directory

cp this key into ~/.ssh/
