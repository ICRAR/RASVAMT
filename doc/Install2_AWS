AWS Installation Instructions
=============================

The local installation (install.txt) is for those investigating the functionality of RASVAMA.
This AWS installation creates a cloud instance using Amazon Web Services, this is used by ICRAR to host other software.

i.	Essential requirements
==============================

1. python 2.7			(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. Mac or Linux 		(Does not work on windows OS)
3. pip (optional) 		(https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
4. virtualenv (optional) 	(http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html#installation)
5. python package flask 	(http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/)


ii.	Full deploy using AWS
==============================
A full deployment uses amazon web services (AWS) to create a cloud deployment.
It relies on a few extra packages to do this.
1. Get the python package fabric3 ( pip install fabric3 )
	- Fabric is a ssh command line utility and allows us to easily set up our deployment
2. Get the python package boto (pip install boto):
	- Boto essentially allows you to connect and run stuff with AWS
3. Set up AWS essentials:
	- First youâ€™ll need an AWS account( https://aws.amazon.com/ )
	- Need IAM ( your AWS access key and AWS secret key and this to home directory in file called .boto)
	- See AWS Installation for more advice
4. run fab hl.aws_deploy in root directory of RASVAMT checkout

iii.	AWS installation
========================
If logged in go to aws https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#users 
Create new key and download credentials
Create group administrator
Add user to group
Configuring Boto Credentials
http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
Then run the command:
fab hl.aws_deploy
This will create a security group if non existent and also a key-pair. The key file icrar_rasvamt.pem will
be copied into ~/.ssh/

You may also need github ssh keys

aws_access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOURSECRETKEY
